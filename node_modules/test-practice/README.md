Action in JS

Why use functions?
- makes our code reusable
- allows us to compartmentalise our code
- allows ud to work asynchronously

What ae the three sources of function?
-create our functions ourselves
-inbuilt methods that we can access on any js file (e.g. forEach, sum, reduce, filter)
-imported functions (such as jest from npm)

different ways to write a function 
- es6 arrow function
- function keywords use

recursion 
- the function call itself

debugging
- 

publishing an npm package (Jaden Case Strings - capitalised every letter of every word in the sentence )
- in the package.json change the main to main.js (the file where the function is)
and add npm version 1.0.0
- then run npm plublish in the terminal
- find the generated link for publishing and check it

We now know how to use array methods but what about number and string methods?
